Task 1- SMS Classifier : Develop a text classification model to classify SMS as either spam or non-spam using data science techniques in Python.
\nDataset used: https://www.kaggle.com/code/mramzanali/sms-spam-classifier
\nConvolutional Neural Network has been used to create a model
When an image is entered as input, it produces either array([[0.]] or array([[1.]] as output; where Cat is equivalent to arr[0] and dog equivalent to arr[1].


Task 2- Cat and Dog Image Classifier : Develop an image classification model to distinguish between images of cats and dogs using data science techniques in Python.
Dataset used: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/salader/dogs-vs-cats
Multinomial Naive Bayes Algorithm has been used to build the model.
The procedure is as follows:
  ~ Data Cleaning
  ~ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
  ~ Data Pre-Processing
  ~ Model Building
  ~ Improving the Model
